<b>Screencast Capture Lite</b> is a tool for recording the desktop screen and saving it to a video file, preserving quality as much as possible. However, this does not mean it produces gigantic files which take a long time to be uploaded to the web. The application encodes everything using solely H624 in an almost lossless setting.<br /></blockquote></blockquote>

The application currently supports recording from the primary screen, from a chosen window or from a fixed region. There are few options to configure encoding at this time, mostly on purpose to keep things simple.

The software stores videos on the _My Videos_ directory and allows the user to browse them directly from within the application. The software has just been released, so it is expected to have a few bugs. If you wish, please leave any issues you encounter at the project [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/accord/issues/list).

Screencast Capture Lite is also a live demonstration of the [Accord.NET Framework](https://code.google.com/p/accord/) in a real-world application.
